## Organization Design / Team Dynamics

- [How Do Committees Invent?](http://www.melconway.com/Home/pdf/committees.pdf) :small_orange_diamond:<sup>PDF</sup> - Melvin E. Conway, Datamation magazine 1968. The original article defining Conway's Law.
- [Service per Team](https://microservices.io/patterns/decomposition/service-per-team.html) - Each team is responsible for one or more business functions (e.g. business capabilities). A team owns a code base consisting of one or more modules. Its code base is sized so as to not exceed the cognitive capacity of team. The team deploys its code as one or more services. A team should have exactly one service unless there is a proven need to have multiple services.
- [Start with Team Cognitive Load - Team Topologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haejb5rzKsM) :small_red_triangle:<sup>YT</sup> - DOES19 London. The "monoliths vs microservices" debate often focuses on technological aspects, ignoring strategy and team dynamics. Instead of technology, smart-thinking organizations are beginning with team cognitive load as the guiding principle for modern software. In this talk, we explain how and why, illustrated by real case studies.
